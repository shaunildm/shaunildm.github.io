I am an aspiring data scientist passionate about improving products and businesses using analytics. I am knowledgeable about predictive analytics, data visualization, machine learning, statistics, and quantitative analysis. I learned leadership, discipline, and team work from my time enlisted in the U.S. Army as a Cavarly Scout. I deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom as team leader and I eventually became companion cadre/instructor at the Armor Officer Basic Leader Course in Ft. Benning, Ga, where I was training the next generation of Armor Officers on leadership and tactics. After my career in the Army, I gained a firm knowledge base in statistics from studying statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics while attaining my bachelors of science in physics from San Francisco State University. I am currently participating in ongoing research to detect theoretical particles known as dark photons at SFSU. I am now on my path of data science and have completed Dataquest's Data Science in Python courses where I learned many fundamentals of statistics and the foundations of machine learning algorithms. I am excited to use what I've learned and to create an impact to businesses and to learn more.
